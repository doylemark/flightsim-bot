Discord is updating it's Developer TOS/Privacy Policy on August 15th (https://github.com/discord/discord-api-docs/pull/1780) Inline with this, I, (inanely) am required to provide a Privacy Policy for the @Flightsim Discord Server#2844 bot. 

The Privacy Policy is as follows

I, UID 426908542197432321 (hereafter "I"), provide a utility based chat bot (hereafter "the bot") for Discord to you.

Your privacy is very important to me and I am committed to making your privacy a priority. 

**1. Personal Information**

**(i) Temporary Memory Storage**
No personal information will be collected or stored on the remote server. Due to the technical nature of the Discord API, generic information such as your profile's avatar, nitro status and other details defined here (https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/user#user-object) under the **identify scope** . Will be held temporarily in memory on the remote server, until such a time Garbage Collection will automatically occur.

**(ii) Database Storage** 
To facilitate the bot's screenshot competition feature, a submitting user's **UID** and no other user information will be stored on a remote database. This data will be held for a maximum period of 2 weeks, after which it will be terminated.

**2. Third Party Information**
I will not share any details about your account, including UID, username, etc. with any 3rd parties, ever.

**3. Your Rights**
You have the right to request a copy of any of your personal information that the I have in my possession. You also have the right to request that I delete your personal information that I have in my possession. You can exercise these rights by contacting me, here on discord.

(n.b) Members are welcome to do this, but the only information in my possession will only ever be your (public) UID. So this may be somewhat redundant. 

**3. Modifications** 
While I have no intentions to do so, I may be required to update this policy from time to time.

The most current version of this policy is available here:
